I am going to tell you a story about this book: 
over 26 years ago, I bought a book (Java in a 
Nutshell) from O'Reilly and I liked it very much 
due to its simplicity and quality of content. Then 
I said to myself: "***I wish I can publish with O'Reilly 
one day***". Now, my dream is fulfilled with publishing 
two books with O'Reilly (which I am very proud of). My 
last book is very special to me: since the 
[FOREWORD](./docs/FOREWORD_by_Dr_Matei_Zaharia.md) 
is written by an outstanding and caring person, 
brilliant software engineer, Professor, and CTO: 
Dr. Matei Zaharia, who created Spark. I have been 
actively using Spark (simple but powerful) for solving genomics 
problems for the past 10 years. Big thank you to Dr. Matei 
Zaharia for writing FOREWORD for my book.
