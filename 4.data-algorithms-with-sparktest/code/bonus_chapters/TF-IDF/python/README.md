# TF-IDF

TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) is a 
statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is 
to a document in a collection of documents. 
This is done by multiplying two metrics: how many times a 
word appears in a document, and the inverse document 
frequency of the word across a set of documents.
