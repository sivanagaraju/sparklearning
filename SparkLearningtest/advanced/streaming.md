## Spark Streaming

Stream processing is the act of continuously incorporating new data to calculate results. The input data is unbounded and has no predetermined beginning or end.

Examples-

- Credit card transactions
- IOT device data
- Click stream

Any business logic in your application should give same results for streaming and batch applications.
